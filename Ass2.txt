Here is the plain text summary of the document.

This document outlines Experiment 2, which focuses on executing essential Ubuntu shell commands for file manipulation and viewing file content.

First, there are pre-requisite steps to set up the exercise:
Create a directory of your name (e.g., mkdir DKB).
Change into that new directory (e.g., cd DKB).
Create an empty file named fruits.txt (e.g., touch fruits.txt).
Add 7 fruit names into the file, each on a new line (e.g., using the echo -e command with a list of fruits).

The document then lists 20 tasks to be performed on the fruits.txt file, along with the corresponding shell commands for each. These tasks are:

1. View the Contents of the File
using cat fruits.txt

2. Count the Number of Lines
using wc -l fruits.txt

3. Display the First Few Lines
using head-n 3 fruits.txt

4. Display the Last Few Lines
using tail -n 3 fruits.txt

5. Search for a Specific Pattern
using grep 'berry' fruits.txt

6. Delete Lines Containing a Specific Pattern
using sed '/banana/d' fruits.txt > modified_fruits.txt

7. Insert a Line at a Specific Position
using sed '3i grape' fruits.txt > modified_fruits.txt

8. Replace a Specific Pattern
using sed 's/banana/mango/' fruits.txt > modified_fruits.txt

9. Append Text to the End of the File
using echo "grapes" >> fruits.txt

10. Sort the Contents of the File
using sort fruits.txt > sorted_fruits.txt

11. Display Line Numbers
using nl fruits.txt

12. Reverse the Order of Lines
using tac fruits.txt

13. Display Lines Matching a Specific Pattern
using grep 'a' fruits.txt

14. Count Words in the File
using wc-w fruits.txt

15. Display Lines Within a Range
using sed -n '3,5p' fruits.txt

16. Remove Duplicate Lines
using sort fruits.txt / uniq > modified_fruits.txt

17. Check for a Specific Word and Display its Line Number
using grep -n 'watermelon' fruits.txt

18. Calculate the Length of Each Line
using awk '{ print length, $0}' fruits.txt

19. Check if a File Contains a Specific Word
using grep -q 'banana' fruits.txt && echo "Found" // echo "Not Found"

20. Create a Backup of a File
using cp fruits.txt backup_fruits.txt
