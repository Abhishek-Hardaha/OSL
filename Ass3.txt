Here is the plain text summary of the document.

This document describes Experiment 3, which involves using advanced shell commands and utilities to perform complex file searches, data processing, and manipulation.

The first part covers advanced shell commands for complex file searches.
A table explains various options for the `find` command:
-name pattern: Searches for files with a specific name or pattern.
-type type: Specifies the file type (e.g., f for regular files, d for directories).
-size +/-n: Searches for files based on size (+n for larger, -n for smaller).
-mtime n: Finds files based on modification time in days (n).
-print: Displays the path names of matching files.
-maxdepth levels: Restricts the search to a specified directory depth.
-mindepth levels: Specifies the minimum directory depth for the search.
-empty: Finds empty files and directories.
-delete: Deletes files that match the criteria.

Examples are provided for these search commands:
Command 1: Finding Files by Name (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-name "data.csv")
Command 2: Finding Directories (e.g., find /home/student-type d) or files (e.g., find /home/student-type f)
Command 3: Finding Files by Size (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-type f-size +50M)
Command 4: Finding Files by Modification Time (e.g., find /home/student-type f-mtime 10)
Command 5: Printing File Paths (e.g., find/home/student/DKB -name "*.pdf" -print)
Command 6: Limiting Search Depth (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-maxdepth 2 -type f-name "*.jpg")
Command 7: Specifying Minimum Search Depth (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-mindepth 2 -type f-name "*.jpg")
Command 8: Finding Empty Files and Directories (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-empty)
Command 9: Deleting files (e.g., find /home/student/DKB-type f-empty-delete)

The second part of the document covers data processing and manipulation.
It requires setting up a directory (e.g., mkdir DKB) and creating a `data.csv` file.
Two methods for creating and populating the file are shown.
Method 1 uses `touch` or `printf` to create the file and `printf` with `>>` to append 10 entries (e.g., "Alice, 30, Engineer").
Method 2 uses the `nano` text editor (e.g., nano data.csv) to add content and then save (Ctrl+O) and exit (Ctrl+X).

A list of 10 tasks to be performed on the `data.csv` file is given:
1. Displaying the File Contents
2. Selecting Specific Columns
3. Extracting Specific Rows
4. Filtering Rows Based on a Condition
5. Sorting Data
6. Counting the Number of Rows
7. Finding Unique Values in a Column
8. Counting the Number of Unique Values in a Column
9. Replacing a Value in a Specific Column
10. Calculating the Average Value of a Column

Finally, the commands for each task are provided:
1. Displaying the File Contents
cat data.csv
2. Selecting Specific Columns
cut -d',' -f 1,3 data.csv
3. Extracting Specific Rows
sed -n '2,4p' data.csv
4. Filtering Rows Based on a Condition
awk -F, '$2>30' data.csv
5. Sorting Data
sort -t',' -k 2,2n data.csv
6. Counting the Number of Rows
wc -l data.csv
7. Finding Unique Values in a Column
cut -d',' -f 3 data.csv | sort | uniq
8. Counting the Number of Unique Values in a Column
cut -d',' -f 3 data.csv | sort | uniq | wc -l
9. Replacing a Value in a Specific Column
sed 's/Engineer/Software Engineer/' data.csv > updated_data.csv
10. Calculating the Average Value of a Column
awk -F, '{sum+=$2; count+=1} END {print "Average Age:", sum/count}' data.csv
